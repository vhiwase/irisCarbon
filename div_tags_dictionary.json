STATEMENTS\nCYBEROPTICS CORPORATION\n\n\n1. INTERIM REPORTING:\n\nThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of CyberOptics\u00a0Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (\"we\", \"us\" or \"our\") presented herein as of September 30, 2021, and for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2021 and\u00a02020, are unaudited but, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary, for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.\n\nThe results of operations for the\u00a0three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2021 do not necessarily indicate the results to be expected for the full year. The December 31, 2020 consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n2. COVID-19 PANDEMIC:\n\nEffect of Covid-19 Outbreak on Business Operations\n\nA novel strain of coronavirus (\"Covid-19\") was first identified in December 2019, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized Covid-19\u00a0as a pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting our customers, suppliers, service providers and employees to varying degrees, and the ultimate impacts of Covid-19, including the potential impact of known and future variants, on our business, results of operations, liquidity and prospects are not fully known at this time.\u00a0The\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0outbreak has not had a significant impact on our business to date. However, the following factors have affected and may continue to affect our business:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nOur key factories are located in Minnesota and Singapore. Both of these locations have been subject to government mandated shelter-in-place orders. Because our operations have been deemed essential, we were able to keep our factories up and running while the shelter-in-place mandates were in effect. If the pandemic worsens, it is possible that our operations may not be deemed essential under future government mandated shelter-in-place orders, and we may be required to shut-down factory operations. We have periodically implemented split-shifts for our factory operations to minimize the number of employees in our facilities at any given time, but these measures have not affected our production capacity. Since the start of the pandemic, many of our non-factory employees have spent the majority of their time working remotely.\u00a0To date, the shelter-in-place mandates and remote work arrangements have had a minimal impact on operations, but material negative effects on our business could result if the pandemic worsens and continues for an extended period of time.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\nSales of some products, mainly our SQ3000\u00a0Multi-Function systems and MX memory module inspection products, require customer acceptance due to performance or other criteria that is considered more than a formality. Most of our customer\u2019s factories have remained open during the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic because they are deemed to be essential under government shelter-in-place mandates. However, global travel restrictions and quarantine measures have hindered our ability to obtain customer acceptances of certain products at various times in 2020. Continuing or new global travel restrictions and quarantine measures could hinder our ability to obtain customer acceptances in a timely manner in the future, and therefore impact the timing of revenue recognition.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\nWe have experienced some supply disruptions due to the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic, mainly from suppliers not deemed essential by shelter-in-place mandates in certain countries. Key supply chain disruptions have been resolved to date. However, supply chain disruptions could increase significantly if the pandemic worsens and continues for an extended period of time. To date, our on-hand inventories have been sufficient to enable us to mitigate supply disruptions.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we cannot estimate the continuing impact of the Covid-19 outbreak at this time, it may have an adverse effect on our results of future operations, financial position and liquidity for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Covid-19 Relief Legislation\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") was signed into law in the United States. The CARES Act, among\u00a0other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback\u00a0periods and alternative tax credit refunds. The CARES Act also appropriated funds for the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loans that are forgivable in certain circumstances to promote continued employment. Additional relief packages were passed in December 2020 and March 2021. We have analyzed these pieces of legislation and presently do not believe they will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we will continue to monitor the impact these pieces of legislation could have on our business in the future.\n\nSingapore Jobs Support Program\n\nThe Singapore Government implemented a jobs support program in 2020 that was intended to support businesses and encourage retention of employees during the\u00a0period of economic uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the jobs support program, the Singapore Government co-funded a portion of the gross monthly wages paid to local employees, which reduced our operating expenses\u00a0in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 by $76,000 and $371,000, respectively.\u00a0We did not receive any material benefit from the Singapore jobs support program in the three or nine months ended September\u00a030, 2021, nor do we expect to receive any material benefits in future periods.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3. RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS:\u00a0\n\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement\u00a0of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u00a0which revises guidance for the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments within its scope, and in November 2018, issued ASU No. 2018-19, which amended the standard. The new standard introduces\u00a0an approach to estimating credit losses that is based on expected losses (referred to as the current expected credit losses model), and applies to most financial assets measured\u00a0at amortized cost and certain other instruments, including available-for-sale marketable debt securities, trade and other receivables. The new standard is effective for us on January 1, 2023, with early adoption permitted. We are required to apply the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning\u00a0of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. We presently\u00a0do not believe the new standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial\u00a0statements.\u00a0\n\nNo other new accounting pronouncements are expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.

Changes in contract liabilities primarily resulted from reclassification of beginning contract liabilities to revenue as performance obligations were satisfied or from cash received in advance and not recognized as revenue.\u00a0See Note 9 for changes in contractual obligations related to deferred warranty revenue. Unsatisfied performance obligations for deferred warranty revenue are generally expected to be recognized as revenue over the next one to three years.

all have maturities of less than five years. Net pre-tax unrealized gains for marketable debt securities of $\u2014 at September 30, 2021 and $229,000 at December 31, 2020 have been recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders\u2019 equity. We have determined that the net pre-tax unrealized losses for marketable debt securities at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were caused by fluctuations in interest rates and are temporary in nature. We review our marketable debt securities to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We received proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $0 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The gain recognized on the sale was insignificant.\u00a0\u00a0No marketable securities were sold in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. \u00a0See Note 6 for additional information regarding the fair value of our investments in marketable securities.\n\nInvestments\u00a0in marketable securities classified as cash equivalents of $-\u00a0million at\u00a0September 30, 2021 and $1.3 million at December 31, 2020, consist of commercial money market savings accounts, corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit. There were no\u00a0unrealized gains or losses associated with any of these securities at September 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\n\nCash\u00a0and\u00a0marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries totaled $\u2014\u00a0million at\u00a0September 30, 2021\u00a0and $672,000 at December 31, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:\n\nWe determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We use a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last\u00a0is considered unobservable, to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level\u00a01). The next highest priority is based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets or other observable inputs (Level 2). The lowest priority is given to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\u00a0The following provides information regarding fair value measurements for our marketable securities as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020\u00a0according to the three-level fair value hierarchy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nFair Value Measurements atSeptember 30, 2021\u00a0Using\n\n\n\n\n (In thousands) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBalance\nSeptember 30,\u00a02021\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Quoted\u00a0Pricesin\u00a0ActiveMarkets\u00a0forIdenticalAssets(Level\u00a01) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level\u00a02) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level\u00a03) \n\n\n\n\n Marketable securities: \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n U.S. government and agency obligations \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit\u00a0\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Asset backed securities \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Equity security \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Total marketable securities\u00a0\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nFair Value Measurements atDecember 31, 2020\u00a0Using\n\n\n\n\n (In thousands) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBalance\nDecember 31,\n2020\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Quoted\u00a0Pricesin\u00a0ActiveMarkets\u00a0forIdenticalAssets(Level\u00a01) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level\u00a02) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level\u00a03) \n\n\n\n\n Marketable securities: \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n U.S. government and agency obligations \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 12,448 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 12,448 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 7,169 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 7,169 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Asset backed securities \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 2,526 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 2,526 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Equity security \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 30 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 30 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Total marketable securities \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 22,173 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 30 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 22,143 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, we owned no Level 3 securities and there were no transfers within the three level hierarchy. A significant transfer is recognized when the inputs used to value a security have been changed which merit a transfer between the levels of the valuation hierarchy.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe fair value for our U.S. government and agency obligations, corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit and asset backed securities are determined based on valuations provided by external investment managers who obtain them from a variety of industry standard data providers. The fair value for our equity security is based on a quoted market price obtained from an active market. The carrying amounts of financial instruments included in cash equivalents approximate their related fair values due to the short-term maturities of those instruments. See Note 5 for additional information regarding our investments in marketable securities.\n\n\nNon-financial assets such as equipment and leasehold improvements, goodwill and intangible assets and right-of-use assets for operating leases are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed impaired. We had no re-measurements of non-financial assets to fair value in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 or the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fair value for\u00a0trade notes receivable is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates that would be offered for a similar\u00a0transaction to a similarly situated customer. The difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for trade notes receivable is immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in\u00a0the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2021, our trade notes receivable were deemed to be fully collectible, and no trade notes receivable were past due more than 90 days or in a non-accrual status with respect to interest income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION:\n\nWe have\u00a0three\u00a0share-based compensation plans that are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. We have (a) an Employee Stock Incentive Plan for officers, other employees, consultants and independent contractors under which we have granted options and restricted stock units to officers and other employees, (b) an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which shares of our common stock may be acquired by employees at discounted prices, and (c) a Non-Employee Director Stock Plan that provides for automatic grants of restricted shares of our common stock to non-employee directors. New shares of our common stock are issued upon stock option exercises, vesting of restricted stock units, issuances of shares to board members and issuances of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\u00a0\nEmployee Stock Incentive Plan\n\u00a0\nAs of\u00a0September 30, 2021, there were\u00a0\u2014\u00a0shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to future awards under our Employee Stock Incentive Plan and \u2014 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to outstanding awards under such plan. Although our Compensation Committee has authority to issue options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, share grants and other share-based benefits under our Employee Stock Incentive Plan, to date only restricted stock units and stock options have been granted under the plan. Options have been granted at an option price per share equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a four year period\u00a0and expire seven years\u00a0after the date of grant. Restricted stock units vest over a four year\u00a0period and entitle the holders to one share of our common stock for each restricted stock unit. Reserved shares underlying outstanding awards, including options and restricted stock units, that are forfeited are available under the Employee Stock Incentive Plan for future grant.\n\n\nNon-Employee Director Stock Plan\n\n\u00a0\nAs of September 30, 2021, there were\u00a0\u2014 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to future restricted share grants under our Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and \u2014 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to outstanding stock option awards under our Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (which previously authorized the granting of stock options to non-employee directors).\u00a0Under the terms of the plan, each non-employee director receives annual restricted share grants of\u00a02,000 shares of our common stock on the date of each annual meeting at which such director is elected to serve on the board. The annual restricted share grants of common stock vest in four equal quarterly installments during the year after the grant date, provided the non-employee director is still serving as a director on the applicable vesting date.\u00a0\n\nOn the date of our 2021\u00a0annual meeting, we issued\u00a08,000 shares of our common stock to our non-employee directors, which were restricted as specified in the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. The shares granted at the 2021 annual meeting had an aggregate fair market value on the date of grant equal to $224,000 (grant date fair value of $27.96 per share). As of September 30, 2021, none of these shares were vested. The aggregate fair value of the \u2014 unvested shares based on the closing price of our common stock on September 30, 2021 was $\u2014.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Option Activity\n\n\nThe following is a summary of stock option activity in the six months ended\u00a0September 30, 2021:\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Options Outstanding \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Weighted\u00a0Average\u00a0ExercisePrice\u00a0Per\u00a0Share \n\n\n\n\n Outstanding, December 31, 2020 \n\n\n 419,100 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 15.22 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Exercised \n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Outstanding, September 30, 2021 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Exercisable, September 30, 2021 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intrinsic value of an option is the amount by which the market price of the underlying common stock exceeds the option's exercise price.

Restricted stock units can be granted under our Employee Stock Incentive Plan. There were no restricted stock units granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The fair value of restricted shares and restricted stock units is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.\u00a0The aggregate fair value of outstanding restricted shares and restricted\u00a0stock units based on the closing share price of our common stock as of September 30, 2021 was $\u2014\u00a0million. The aggregate fair value of restricted shares and restricted stock units that vested, based on the closing price of our common stock on the vesting date, was $\u2014\u00a0in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and $179,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

We utilize the straight-line method of expense recognition over the award's\u00a0service period for our graded vesting options. The fair value of stock options has been determined using the Black-Scholes model. We account for the impact of forfeitures related to employee share-based payment arrangements when the forfeitures occur. We have classified employee share-based compensation within our consolidated statements of income in the same manner as our cash-based employee compensation costs.\u00a0\nPre-tax share-based compensation expense in the three months ended September 30, 2021 totaled $\u2014, and included $\u2014 for stock options, $\u2014 for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, $\u2014 for restricted stock

While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of components provided by suppliers, warranty obligations do arise. These obligations are affected by product failure rates, the costs of materials used in correcting product failures and service delivery expenses incurred to make these corrections. If actual product failure rates and material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are required and could be material. At the end of each reporting period, we revise our estimated warranty liability based on these factors. The current portion of our warranty liability is included as a component of accrued expenses.

NET INCOME PER SHARE:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNet income per basic share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Net income per diluted share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares consist of common shares to be issued upon exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units, vesting of restricted shares and from purchases of shares under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as calculated using the treasury stock method. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation of net income per diluted share if their effect is anti-dilutive.

INCOME TAXES:\n\nWe recorded income tax expense of $\u2014 in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to an income tax expense of $409,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2020. We recorded income tax expense of $\u2014 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to income tax expense of $462,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Our income tax expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflected an effective tax rate of approximately \u2014%, compared to an effective tax rate of approximately 10% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in effective income tax rate in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, was mainly due to a significant reduction in excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. Excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were negligible, compared to excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 of $0 and $0, respectively. On a recurring basis, our effective income tax rate is favorably impacted by the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, foreign tax credit and the impact from Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).\n\nWe have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and U.S.\u00a0GAAP income, R&D tax credit carry forwards and state net operating loss carry forwards. A deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes, when net operating loss carry forwards could be applied against future taxable income, or when tax credit carry forwards are utilized on our tax returns. We assess the\u00a0realizability\u00a0of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of any current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry forward periods, our experience with loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. In analyzing the need for valuation allowances, we first considered our history of cumulative operating results for income tax purposes over the past three years in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, our financial performance in recent quarters, statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives. In addition, we considered both our near-term and long-term financial outlook. After considering all available evidence (both positive and negative), we concluded that recognition of valuation allowances for substantially all of our U.S. and Singapore based deferred tax assets was not required at September 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has initiated a routine compliance review of our\u00a02018\u00a0income tax return.\u00a0We presently anticipate that the outcome of this audit will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n15. CONTINGENCIES:\u00a0\n\nWe are periodically a defendant in miscellaneous lawsuits, claims and disputes in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management presently believes the disposition of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\u00a0\n\nIn the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products and services, we at times indemnify other parties, including customers, with respect to certain matters. In these instances, we have agreed to hold the other parties harmless against losses arising out of intellectual property infringement or other types of claims. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made, and almost always limits the amount of the claim. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made, if any, under these agreements have not had a material impact on our operating results, financial position or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that intellectual property infringement and other claims against us or parties we have indemnified will not have a greater impact in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:\n\n The following management\u2019s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of CyberOptics Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (\"we\", \"us\" and \"our\") contains a number of estimates and predictions that are forward looking statements rather than statements based on historical fact. Among other matters, we discuss (i) a possible world-wide recession or depression resulting from the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic; (ii) the potential effect on our revenue and operating results of the Covid-19 crisis on our customers and suppliers, the markets for our products and the global supply chain; (iii) the availability of parts to meet customer orders; (iv) the level of anticipated revenues, gross margins, and expenses; (v) the timing of orders and shipments of our existing products, particularly our SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems for automated optical inspection (\"AOI\") and MX systems for memory module inspection; (vi) the level of orders from our original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") customers; (vii) the timing of initial revenue and projected improvements in gross margins from sales of new products that have been recently introduced, that we have under development or that we anticipate introducing in the future; (viii) the timing of and improvement in gross margins resulting from future cost reduction programs; (ix) market acceptance of our SQ3000 Multi-Function systems and products for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology; (x) our assessment of trends in the surface mount technology (\"SMT\") and semiconductor capital equipment markets; (xi) the impact of lower margin MX3000\u2122 memory module inspection systems on our consolidated gross margin in any future period; (xii) risks related to cancellation or renegotiation of orders we have received; and (xiii) changes in the level of tariffs and other trade policies of the United States, and trade relations with other countries. Although we have made these statements based on our experience and expectations regarding future events, there may be events or factors that we have not anticipated. Therefore, the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and estimates are subject to a number of risks, including those risks identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\n\nWe are a leading global developer and manufacturer of high precision 3D sensors and system products for inspection and metrology. We also develop and manufacture our WaferSense\u00ae products, which is a family of wireless, wafer-shaped sensors that provide measurements of critical factors in the semiconductor fabrication process. We intend to leverage our sensor technologies in the SMT and semiconductor industries to deliver profitable growth. A key element of our strategy is the continued development and sale of high precision 3D sensors and system products based on our proprietary Multi-Reflection Suppression\u2122 (MRS\u2122) technology. We believe that our MRS technology is a breakthrough 3D optical technology for high-end inspection and metrology with the potential to significantly expand our markets. Another key element in our strategy is the continued development and introduction of new sensor applications for our WaferSense\u00ae family of products.\n\u00a0\nWe believe that conditions in the SMT and semiconductor capital equipment markets are currently robust, and we believe this market strength will continue into the foreseeable future. Over the longer-term (i.e. the next several years), we expect a growing number of opportunities in the markets for SMT and semiconductor inspection and metrology. We believe that our 3D MRS sensor and system products and our WaferSense family of products have the potential to expand our presence in the markets for SMT and semiconductor capital equipment.\n\nManufacturing yield challenges as electronics and semiconductors become more complex are driving the need for more precise inspection and metrology. We believe\u00a03D inspection and metrology represent\u00a0high-growth segments in both the SMT and semiconductor capital equipment markets.\u00a0We believe\u00a0our 3D MRS technology platform is well suited for many applications in these markets, particularly with respect to complex circuit boards and semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology applications.\u00a0We are taking advantage of current market trends by deploying our 3D MRS sensor technology in the following products:\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n Our SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems for Automated Optical Inspection (AOI), Solder Paste Inspection (SPI) and coordinate measurement (CMM) applications, which are designed to expand our presence in markets requiring high precision inspection and metrology. In these markets, identifying defects has become highly challenging and critical due to smaller semiconductor and electronics packaging and increasing component density on circuit boards. We believe the 3D MRS sensor technology used in our products is uniquely suited for many of these applications because of its ability to offer microscopic image quality and superior measurement performance at production line speeds. We are developing an enhanced version of the SQ3000 Multi-Function system that will allow for inspection and metrology of features sizes down to 50-microns at in-line production speeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n Our next generation MX3000\u2122 AOI system for 3D inspection of memory modules following the\u00a0singulation\u00a0step of the manufacturing process.\u00a0We recognized our first revenue from the sale of the MX3000\u00a0in the first quarter of 2020. Since late 2020, we have received new purchase orders for the MX3000 valued at $8.1 million. We recognized $0.0 million of the MX3000 orders as revenue in the third quarter of 2021, and expect to recognize a further $0.0 million of the MX3000 orders as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nOur next generation ultra-high resolution three micron pixel 3D NanoResolution\u00a0MRS\u2122 sensor, which is capable of measuring feature sizes down to 25 microns accurately and at high speeds, and is suitable for many semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology applications. We have adapted the software used in our SQ3000 Multi-Function systems to work with wafer handling equipment to facilitate sales of our 3D NanoResolution\u00a0MRS sensor to OEM's\u00a0and system integrators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n Our new WX3000\u2122 metrology and inspection system for wafer and advanced packing applications, which incorporates our next generation ultra-high resolution 3D NanoResolution MRS sensor. The WX3000 performs 100% 3D and 2D inspection and metrology simultaneously at high speeds and delivers through-put of more than 25 wafers per hour. We believe the WX3000 performs two to three times faster than alternate technologies at data processing speeds in excess of 75 million 3D data points per second. The WX3000 is suitable for many semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology applications for feature sizes down to 25-microns. We anticipate that sales of sensors and systems based on our\u00a03D MRS technology for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology applications will provide us with long-term growth opportunities.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRevenue from our MRS-based products, including 3D AOI systems and high precision 3D MRS sensors, increased by $0.0 million or 0% to $0.0 million in the nine months ended September 30,\u00a02021, from $23.8 million in the nine months ended september 30,\u00a02020. Over the long term, we anticipate continued increases in sales of products based on our MRS technology in the SMT and semiconductor capital equipment markets. In particular, we believe inspection and metrology for mini LED, memory modules and semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging applications represent significant long-term growth opportunities. We anticipate increasing sales of MRS-based products by selling them to new OEM customers and system integrators, and by expanding direct sales of inspection and metrology system products to end-user customers.\u00a0\n\nWe have continued to invest in our\u00a0WaferSense\u00a0family of products, because fabricators of semiconductors and other customers view these products as valuable tools for improving yields and productivity. We have recently introduced several new WaferSense\u00a0products to further increase our revenue growth, including the\u00a0In-Line Particle Sensor\u2122\u00a0(IPS\u2122). This sensor detects particles in gas and vacuum lines in semiconductor process equipment, and is particularly relevant for EUV lithography tools. Additional WaferSense\u00a0applications are currently under development. Over the long-term, strong future sales growth is anticipated for our WaferSense\u00a0family of products.\u00a0\n\nOur order backlog was a record $0.0 million at September 30, 2021, up from $45.3 million at June 30, 2021, and up from $17.7 million at September 30, 2020. Our backlog at September 30, 2021 includes approximately $0.0 million of longer-term orders from OEM customers that are scheduled for shipment in periods after 2021.\u00a0We\u00a0are forecasting sales of $0.0 million to $0.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2021\u00a0ending December 31, compared to $0.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.\u00a0Our forecast for the fourth quarter of 2021 includes $0.0 million of sales from our order backlog of MX memory module inspection systems. It is anticipated that there will be no revenue from MX memory module systems in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to normal quarterly variability\u00a0in the sales of these products. For this reason, aggregate sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 are expected to be lower than the third quarter of 2021 on a sequential quarterly basis. However, strong year-over-year sales growth is anticipated for the fourth quarter of 2021 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, which we believe will be driven by the Company's record backlog and the robust capital spending environment. We believe that demand in the SMT and semiconductor capital equipment markets will remain strong into the foreseeable future. However, an increase in the severity of the current Covid-19 outbreak, or a resulting prolonged economic recession or depression, could cause a slow-down in demand for SMT and semiconductor capital equipment. Over the long term, we believe\u00a0anticipated sales growth of our products based on\u00a03D MRS technology and WaferSense\u00a0sensors should increase revenues and net income. We believe that we have the resources required to attain our growth objectives, given our available cash and marketable securities balances totaling $0.0 million at September 30, 2021.\n\nImpact from\u00a0Covid-19\n\nEffect of Covid-19 Outbreak on Business Operations\n\nCovid-19 was first identified in December 2019, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized Covid-19 as a pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting our customers, suppliers, service providers and employees to varying degrees, and the ultimate impacts of Covid-19, including the potential impact of known and future variants, on our business, results of operations, liquidity and prospects are not fully known at this time. However, the Covid-19 outbreak has had a relatively minimal impact on our business to date. Our revenues increased by 0% to $0.0 million in the first nine months of 2021, from $53.2 million in the first nine months of 2020. We are forecasting sales of $0.0 million to $0.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2021\u00a0ending September 30, compared to $0.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our forecast for the fourth quarter of 2021 could change if the Covid-19 pandemic worsens, or if unforeseen events related to the pandemic occur. The most significant impacts on our business from the Covid-19 pandemic include the following:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nOur key factories are located in Minnesota and Singapore. Both of these locations have been subject to government mandated shelter-in-place orders. Because our operations have been deemed essential, we were able to keep our factories up and running while the shelter-in-place mandates were in effect. If the pandemic worsens, it is possible that our operations may not be deemed essential under future government mandated shelter-in-place orders, and we may be required to shut-down factory operations. We have periodically implemented split-shifts for our factory operations to minimize the number of employees in our facilities at any given time, but these measures have not affected our production capacity. Since the start of the pandemic, many of our non-factory employees have spent the majority of their time working remotely. To date, the shelter-in-place mandates and remote work arrangements have had a minimal impact on operations, but that could change if the pandemic worsens and is more than temporary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\nSales of some products, mainly our SQ3000 Multi-Function systems and MX memory module inspection products, require customer acceptance due to performance or other criteria that is considered more than a formality. Most of our customer\u2019s factories have remained open during the Covid-19 pandemic because they are deemed to be essential under government shelter-in-place mandates. However, global travel restrictions and quarantine measures have hindered our ability to obtain customer acceptances of certain of our products at various times in 2020. Continuing or new global travel restrictions and quarantine measures could hinder our ability to obtain customer acceptances in a timely manner in the future, and therefore impact the timing of revenue recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\nTotal operating expenses were reduced in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0Travel, trade show expenses and other costs were reduced due to changes in employee travel patterns and trade show cancellations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\nWe have experienced some supply disruptions due to the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic, mainly from suppliers not deemed essential by shelter-in-place mandates in certain countries. Key supply chain disruptions have been resolved to date. However, supply chain disruptions could increase significantly if the pandemic worsens and continues for an extended period of time. To date, our on-hand inventories have been sufficient to enable us to mitigate any supply disruptions with minimal impact on our sales or ability to service customers. We\u00a0presently do not expect that Covid-19 related supply chain disruptions will have a significant impact on our revenue in the third quarter of\u00a02021.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe currently do not anticipate any significant credit losses or asset impairments resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. As of September 30, 2021, our available balances of cash and marketable securities totaled $0.0 million. We believe that we have the resources required to attain our growth objectives and to meet any unforeseen difficulties resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we will continue to closely monitor the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on our business in the coming months.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnited States Covid-19 Relief Legislation\u00a0\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") was signed into law in the United States. The CARES Act, among\u00a0other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of\u00a0employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback\u00a0periods and alternative tax credit refunds. The CARES Act also appropriated funds for the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loans that are forgivable in certain circumstances to promote continued employment. Additional relief packages were passed in December 2020 and March 2021. We have analyzed these pieces of legislation and presently do not believe they will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we will continue to monitor the impact that these pieces of legislation could have on our business in the future.\u00a0\n\nSingapore Jobs Support Program\n\nThe Singapore Government implemented a jobs support program in 2020 that was intended to support businesses and encourage retention of employees during the period of economic uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the jobs support program, the Singapore Government co-funded a portion of the gross monthly wages paid to local employees, which reduced our operating expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 by $276,000 and $295,000, respectively. We did not receive any material benefit from the Singapore jobs support program in the three or nine months ended September 30, 2021, nor do we expect to receive any material benefits in future periods.\n\nRevenues\nOur revenues\u00a0decreased\u00a0by 100% to $\u2014\u00a0million in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2021, from $20.8\u00a0million in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2020. Our revenues decreased by 100% to $\u2014 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $53.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0The following table sets forth revenues by product line for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n\n\n\n(In thousands)\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n% Change\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n% Change\n\n\n\nHigh Precision 3D\u00a0and 2D Sensors\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,645\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n%\n\n$\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n12,512\n\n\n\n(100)\n%\n\n\n\nInspection and Metrology Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13,339\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29,361\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nSemiconductor Sensors\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3,836\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11,372\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n20,820\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n53,245\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues from sales of high precision 3D and 2D sensors decreased by $3.6 million or 100% to $\u2014 million in the three months ended September 30, 2021, from $3.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Revenues from sales of high precision 3D and 2D sensors decreased by $12.5 million or 100% to $\u2014\u00a0million\u00a0in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $12.5\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increases were due to higher sales of both\u00a03D MRS sensors and legacy 2D sensors resulting from improving conditions in the global semiconductor and SMT capital equipment markets.\u00a0Sales of high precision 3D MRS sensors increased by $0.0 million or 0% to $0.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2021, from $2.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0Sales of high precision 3D MRS sensors increased by $0.0 million or 0% to $0.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $8.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\nSales of high precision 3D and 2D sensors are dependent on the success of our OEM customers and system integrators selling products that incorporate our sensors. We believe sales of our\u00a03D MRS sensors, including our next generation ultra-high resolution three micron pixel 3D NanoResolution MRS sensor, will represent an increasing percentage of our total high precision 3D and 2D sensor sales in the future. Sales of high precision 3D and 2D sensors, including 3D MRS sensors, are prone to significant quarterly fluctuations due to variations in market demand and customer inventory levels. Revenues from sales of high precision 3D and 2D sensors are forecasted to post strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2021.\u00a0\nRevenues from sales of inspection and metrology systems decreased by $13.3 million or 100% to $\u2014 million in the three months ended September 30, 2021, from $13.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Revenues from sales of inspection and metrology systems\u00a0decreased\u00a0by $29.4 million or 100%\u00a0to $\u2014\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $29.4\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0The increases were due to higher sales of SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems and MX3000\u2122 memory module inspection systems resulting from improving market conditions, and increasing sales from more complex applications such as inspection and metrology for mini-LED and memory modules. Sales of\u00a0SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems increased by $0.0 million or 0% to $0.0 million in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2021, from $6.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0Sales of\u00a0SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems\u00a0increased\u00a0by $0.0 million\u00a0or 0% to $0.0\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $14.8\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0Sales of\u00a02D and\u00a03D MX memory module inspection systems totaled $0.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. There were no sales of MX systems in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Sales of 2D and 3D MX systems totaled $4.7 million in the nine months ended september 30, 2020.\u00a0Revenues from sales of inspection and metrology systems are forecasted to grow solidly in the fourth quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis.\u00a0\nWe believe the increase in sales of SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was due to the competitive advantages offered by our SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function system products, particularly for more complex applications,\u00a0and resulted from many companies transitioning from 2D AOI to 3D AOI systems to meet the increasingly demanding product inspection and metrology requirements in the SMT and semiconductor markets. The market transition away from 2D AOI systems is expected to result in an industry-wide 20% compound annual rate of growth in global sales of 3D AOI systems through 2025.\u00a0Given these market dynamics and because of the competitive advantages of our 3D MRS sensor technology, we anticipate sales of SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems will represent an increasing percentage of our total inspection and metrology system sales in the future.\nSince late\u00a02020, we have received new purchase orders for the MX3000\u00a0valued at $8.1 million. We recognized $0.0\u00a0million of the MX3000 orders as revenue in the third quarter of\u00a02021, and expect to recognize a further $0.0 million of the MX3000 orders as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021.\u00a0We believe memory manufacturers have determined that post singulation automated optical inspection of memory modules is an important step in their manufacturing process to improve yields and product quality. Two of the world's three largest memory manufacturers now use either our 2D MX600\u2122 or 3D MX3000 memory module inspection systems. As a result, we believe the potential market opportunity for our 2D and 3D memory module inspection systems is significant and anticipate that sales of these systems will continue in the future.\nRevenues from sales of semiconductor sensors, principally our WaferSense\u00a0line of products, decreased by $0.0 million or 100% to $\u2014 million in the three months ended September 30, 2021, from $3.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Revenues from sales of semiconductor sensors increased by $0.0 million or 100% to $\u2014 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $11.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The revenue increases were due to construction of new semiconductor\u00a0fabs, favorable market conditions for semiconductor capital equipment spending, and the growing acceptance of our WaferSense products as important productivity enhancement tools by semiconductor manufacturers and capital equipment suppliers. Over the long term, we anticipate that the benefits from growing market awareness of our WaferSense products, improved account penetration at major semiconductor manufacturers and capital equipment suppliers and new product introductions will lead to additional WaferSense product sales. Revenues from sales of semiconductor sensors are forecasted to post strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nExport revenues totaled $\u2014 million or #DIV/0!% of our revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $17.5 million or 84% of our revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Export\u00a0revenues\u00a0totaled $\u2014\u00a0million or\u00a0#DIV/0!% of our revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $42.7\u00a0million or\u00a080% of our revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Export revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 due to higher sales of 3D and 2D high precision sensors, semiconductor sensors and\u00a0MX3000\u2122 memory module inspection systems. A higher proportion of these products are generally sold outside the United States as compared to our other products.\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\u00a0\n\nCost of revenues\u00a0decreased\u00a0by $0.0 million or 100% to $\u2014 million in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2021, from $12.1\u00a0million in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2020. Cost of revenues\u00a0decreased\u00a0by $0.0 million\u00a0or\u00a0100% to $\u2014\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $30.0\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020. Total gross margin as a percentage of revenues was\u00a0#DIV/0!%\u00a0in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to\u00a042% in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2020. Total gross margin as a percentage of revenues was\u00a0#DIV/0!% in both the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0The increase in cost of revenues in both periods was mainly due to higher revenues. Revenues increased on a year-over-year basis in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 by 0% and 0%, respectively. Cost of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2021 were negatively impacted by a less favorable sales mix of lower gross margin products. Sales of lower gross margin inspection and metrology system products, including $0.0 million of MX3000\u2122 memory module inspection systems, represented a larger percentage of our total revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2021, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0\n\nOur total gross margin as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021\u00a0is expected to decline by roughly 1-2 percentage points from the level in the third quarter of 2021, reflecting an increased proportion of lower gross margin inspection and metrology systems in our revenue mix, including $4.9 million of MX3000\u00a0memory module inspection systems.\u00a0We anticipate sequential quarterly improvement in our total gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter of 2021, given that we are not expecting any sales of lower gross margin\u00a0MX3000\u2122 systems in the quarter.\u00a0\n\nOur markets are highly price competitive, particularly in the electronics assembly and SMT markets. As a result, we have experienced continual pressure on our gross margins. We compensate for the pressure to reduce the price of our products by introducing new products with more features and improved performance and through manufacturing cost reduction programs. Sales of many products that we have recently introduced or are about to introduce, including our current and future SQ3000\u00a0Multi-Function systems, WX3000 system for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology, next generation 3D MRS sensors and semiconductor sensors (consisting primarily of our WaferSense\u00a0line of products) have, or are expected to have, more favorable gross margins than many of our existing products. Our next generation 3D MRS sensor and system products are being designed for more complex and demanding inspection and metrology applications in the SMT and semiconductor markets. Sales prices and gross profit margins for these applications tend to be higher than margins for products sold in the general purpose SMT market. However, the gross margin percentage for our\u00a03D MX3000\u00a0system for inspection of memory modules will be lower than our current total gross margin percentage due to the significant costs for material handling and automation required for this product.\u00a0\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nR&D expenses were $\u2014 million or #DIV/0!% of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $2.4 million or 12% of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2020. R&D expenses were $\u2014\u00a0million or\u00a0#DIV/0!% of revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $7.0 million or 13% of revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0The increase in R&D expenses in the three and\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021 was mainly due to higher compensation costs for new and existing R&D employees, including incentive compensation accruals, and higher costs for engineering prototypes. R&D expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were reduced by $61,000 and $307,000, respectively, due to the favorable impact of the Singapore Government's jobs support program on wage costs discussed above. Current R&D expenditures are primarily focused on the continued development of our portfolio of next generation 3D\u00a0MRS\u00a0sensor and system products and continued R&D work on WaferSense\u00a0products. We also continue to enhance and develop new generations of our SQ3000\u00a0Multi-Function systems and 3D MX3000 memory module inspection systems.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"S,G&A\") expenses were $\u2014 million or #DIV/0!% of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $4.1 million or 20% of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $\u2014\u00a0million or\u00a0#DIV/0!% of revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $11.9\u00a0million or\u00a022% of revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0The increase in S,G&A expenses in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was due to higher third party channel commissions resulting from the significant revenue increases in both periods, higher accruals for incentive compensation given our improved financial performance, and an increase in our accounts receivable allowance and related expense.\nTotal operating expenses in the third quarter of 2021 are forecasted to be at or near the level in this year's second quarter.\u00a0\n\nInterest Income and Other\n\u00a0\nInterest income and other includes interest earned on investments and gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany financing transactions associated with our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Singapore, China and Taiwan. We recognized losses from foreign currency transactions of $\u2014 in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to losses from foreign currency transactions of $77,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2020. We recognized losses from foreign currency transactions of $\u2014\u00a0in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to gains from foreign currency transactions of $65,000\u00a0in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe recorded income tax expense of $0 in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to an income tax expense of $409,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2020. We recorded income tax expense of $0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to income tax expense of $462,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Our income tax expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflected an effective tax rate of approximately 0%, compared to an effective tax rate of approximately 10% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in effective income tax rate in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, was mainly due to a significant reduction in excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. Excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were negligible, compared to excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 of $0 and $0, respectively. On a recurring basis, our effective income tax rate is favorably impacted by the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, foreign tax credit and the impact from Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).\n\nWe have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between the taxable income on our tax returns and U.S.\u00a0GAAP income, R&D tax credit carry forwards and state net operating loss carry forwards. A deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes, when net operating loss carry forwards could be applied against future taxable income, or when tax credit carry forwards are utilized on our tax returns. We assess the\u00a0realizability\u00a0of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of any current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry forward periods, our experience with credit and loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. In analyzing the need for valuation allowances, we first considered our history of cumulative operating results for income tax purposes over the past three years in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, our financial performance in recent quarters, statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives. In addition, we considered both our near-term and long-term financial outlook. After considering all available evidence (both positive and negative), we concluded that recognition of valuation allowances for substantially all of our U.S. and Singapore based deferred tax assets was not required at September 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has initiated a routine compliance review of our\u00a02018\u00a0income tax return.\u00a0We presently anticipate that the outcome of this audit will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents increased by $0.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Cash provided by operating activities of $0.0 million and proceeds of $0.0 million from maturities and sales of marketable securities were partially offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling $\u2014 million and purchases of fixed assets\u00a0and capitalized patent costs totaling $0.0 million. Proceeds from stock option exercises totaled\u00a0$\u2014. Our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of sales and maturities of marketable securities and investment of cash balances in marketable securities, and from other sources of cash. Accordingly, we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity than cash balances alone. Combined balances of cash and marketable securities decreased by $30.6 million to $\u2014\u00a0million as of September 30, 2021, from $30.6 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\nOperating activities provided $\u2014 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The amount of cash provided by operations was favorably impacted by net income of $\u2014 million. Net income was affected by non-cash expenses totaling $\u2014 million for depreciation and amortization, non-cash operating lease expense, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred taxes, non-cash losses from foreign currency transactions, share-based compensation costs and an unrealized gain on our available-for-sale equity security. Changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash included an increase in accounts payable of $0.0 million and an increase in accrued expenses of $0. Changes in operating assets and liabilities using cash included an increase in accounts and trade notes receivable of $0.0 million, an increase in inventories of $0.0 million and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $0.\u00a0Increases in accounts payable and inventories at September 30, 2021 were due to planned purchases of raw materials to meet anticipated customer demand. The increase in accrued expenses was mainly due to higher accruals for income taxes payable and wages, including incentive compensation, offset in part by payment of 2020 bonus accruals in the first quarter of 2021. Accounts and trade notes receivable increased due to higher sales in the third quarter of 2021 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in operating lease liabilities was due to monthly rental payments for facility leases.\u00a0\n\nInvesting activities used $0.0 million of cash in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021. Changes in the level of investment in marketable securities, resulting from purchases and maturities of those securities, used $0 of cash in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021. We used $0.0 million of cash in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021\u00a0for the purchase of fixed assets and capitalized patent costs.\u00a0\u00a0\nFinancing activities provided $\u2014 of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2021\u00a0from the exercise of employee stock options.\u00a0\nAt\u00a0September 30, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. These entities are established by some companies for the purpose of establishing off-balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nWe believe that on-hand cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, coupled with anticipated future cash flow from operations, will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nITEM 3 \u2013 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nNot applicable.\n\nITEM 4 \u2013 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)).

COVID-19 PANDEMIC:\n\nEffect of Covid-19 Outbreak on Business Operations\n\nA novel strain of coronavirus (\"Covid-19\") was first identified in December 2019, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized Covid-19\u00a0as a pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting our customers, suppliers, service providers and employees to varying degrees, and the ultimate impacts of Covid-19, including the potential impact of known and future variants, on our business, results of operations, liquidity and prospects are not fully known at this time.\u00a0The\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0outbreak has not had a significant impact on our business to date. However, the following factors have affected and may continue to affect our business:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nOur key factories are located in Minnesota and Singapore. Both of these locations have been subject to government mandated shelter-in-place orders. Because our operations have been deemed essential, we were able to keep our factories up and running while the shelter-in-place mandates were in effect. If the pandemic worsens, it is possible that our operations may not be deemed essential under future government mandated shelter-in-place orders, and we may be required to shut-down factory operations. We have periodically implemented split-shifts for our factory operations to minimize the number of employees in our facilities at any given time, but these measures have not affected our production capacity. Since the start of the pandemic, many of our non-factory employees have spent the majority of their time working remotely.\u00a0To date, the shelter-in-place mandates and remote work arrangements have had a minimal impact on operations, but material negative effects on our business could result if the pandemic worsens and continues for an extended period of time.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\nSales of some products, mainly our SQ3000\u00a0Multi-Function systems and MX memory module inspection products, require customer acceptance due to performance or other criteria that is considered more than a formality. Most of our customer\u2019s factories have remained open during the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic because they are deemed to be essential under government shelter-in-place mandates. However, global travel restrictions and quarantine measures have hindered our ability to obtain customer acceptances of certain products at various times in 2020. Continuing or new global travel restrictions and quarantine measures could hinder our ability to obtain customer acceptances in a timely manner in the future, and therefore impact the timing of revenue recognition.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\nWe have experienced some supply disruptions due to the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic, mainly from suppliers not deemed essential by shelter-in-place mandates in certain countries. Key supply chain disruptions have been resolved to date. However, supply chain disruptions could increase significantly if the pandemic worsens and continues for an extended period of time. To date, our on-hand inventories have been sufficient to enable us to mitigate supply disruptions.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we cannot estimate the continuing impact of the Covid-19 outbreak at this time, it may have an adverse effect on our results of future operations, financial position and liquidity for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Covid-19 Relief Legislation\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") was signed into law in the United States. The CARES Act, among\u00a0other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback\u00a0periods and alternative tax credit refunds. The CARES Act also appropriated funds for the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loans that are forgivable in certain circumstances to promote continued employment. Additional relief packages were passed in December 2020 and March 2021. We have analyzed these pieces of legislation and presently do not believe they will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we will continue to monitor the impact these pieces of legislation could have on our business in the future.\n\nSingapore Jobs Support Program\n\nThe Singapore Government implemented a jobs support program in 2020 that was intended to support businesses and encourage retention of employees during the\u00a0period of economic uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the jobs support program, the Singapore Government co-funded a portion of the gross monthly wages paid to local employees, which reduced our operating expenses\u00a0in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 by $76,000 and $371,000, respectively.\u00a0We did not receive any material benefit from the Singapore jobs support program in the three or nine months ended September\u00a030, 2021, nor do we expect to receive any material benefits in future periods.\u00a0\n\n\n"

Most of our customer\u2019s factories have remained open during the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic because they are deemed to be essential under government shelter-in-place mandates. However, global travel restrictions and quarantine measures have hindered our ability to obtain customer acceptances of certain products at various times in 2020. Continuing or new global travel restrictions and quarantine measures could hinder our ability to obtain customer acceptances in a timely manner in the future, and therefore impact the timing of revenue recognition.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\nWe have experienced some supply disruptions due to the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic, mainly from suppliers not deemed essential by shelter-in-place mandates in certain countries. Key supply chain disruptions have been resolved to date. However, supply chain disruptions could increase significantly if the pandemic worsens and continues for an extended period of time. To date, our on-hand inventories have been sufficient to enable us to mitigate supply disruptions.\u00a0\n\n\n"

all have maturities of less than five years. Net pre-tax unrealized gains for marketable debt securities of $\u2014 at September 30, 2021 and $229,000 at December 31, 2020 have been recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders\u2019 equity. We have determined that the net pre-tax unrealized losses for marketable debt securities at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were caused by fluctuations in interest rates and are temporary in nature. We review our marketable debt securities to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We received proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $0 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The gain recognized on the sale was insignificant.\u00a0\u00a0No marketable securities were sold in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. \u00a0See Note 6 for additional information regarding the fair value of our investments in marketable securities.\n\nInvestments\u00a0in marketable securities classified as cash equivalents of $-\u00a0million at\u00a0September 30, 2021 and $1.3 million at December 31, 2020, consist of commercial money market savings accounts, corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit.

all have maturities of less than five years. Net pre-tax unrealized gains for marketable debt securities of $\u2014 at September 30, 2021 and $229,000 at December 31, 2020 have been recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders\u2019 equity. We have determined that the net pre-tax unrealized losses for marketable debt securities at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were caused by fluctuations in interest rates and are temporary in nature. We review our marketable debt securities to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We received proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $0 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. The gain recognized on the sale was insignificant.\u00a0\u00a0No marketable securities were sold in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020. \u00a0See Note 6 for additional information regarding the fair value of our investments in marketable securities.\n\nInvestments\u00a0in marketable securities classified as cash equivalents of $-\u00a0million at\u00a0September 30, 2021 and $1.3 million at December 31, 2020, consist of commercial money market savings accounts, corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit. There were no\u00a0unrealized gains or losses associated with any of these securities at September 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\n\nCash\u00a0and\u00a0marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries totaled $\u2014\u00a0million at\u00a0September 30, 2021\u00a0and $672,000 at December 31, 2020.\n\n\n"

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:\n\nWe determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We use a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last\u00a0is considered unobservable, to measure fair value.

The lowest priority is given to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\u00a0The following provides information regarding fair value measurements for our marketable securities as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020\u00a0according to the three-level fair value hierarchy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nFair Value Measurements atSeptember 30, 2021\u00a0Using\n\n\n\n\n (In thousands) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBalance\nSeptember 30,\u00a02021\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Quoted\u00a0Pricesin\u00a0ActiveMarkets\u00a0forIdenticalAssets(Level\u00a01) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level\u00a02) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level\u00a03) \n\n\n\n\n Marketable securities: \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n U.S. government and agency obligations \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit\u00a0\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Asset backed securities \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Equity security \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Total marketable securities\u00a0\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nFair Value Measurements atDecember 31, 2020\u00a0Using\n\n\n\n\n (In thousands) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBalance\nDecember 31,\n2020\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Quoted\u00a0Pricesin\u00a0ActiveMarkets\u00a0forIdenticalAssets(Level\u00a01) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level\u00a02) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level\u00a03) \n\n\n\n\n Marketable securities: \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n U.S. government and agency obligations \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 12,448 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 12,448 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 7,169 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 7,169 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Asset backed securities \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 2,526 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 2,526 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Equity security \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 30 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 30 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Total marketable securities \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 22,173 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 30 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 22,143 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, we owned no Level 3 securities and there were no transfers within the three level hierarchy.

A significant transfer is recognized when the inputs used to value a security have been changed which merit a transfer between the levels of the valuation hierarchy.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe fair value for our U.S. government and agency obligations, corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit and asset backed securities are determined based on valuations provided by external investment managers who obtain them from a variety of industry standard data providers. The fair value for our equity security is based on a quoted market price obtained from an active market. The carrying amounts of financial instruments included in cash equivalents approximate their related fair values due to the short-term maturities of those instruments. See Note 5 for additional information regarding our investments in marketable securities.\n\n\nNon-financial assets such as equipment and leasehold improvements, goodwill and intangible assets and right-of-use assets for operating leases are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed impaired. We had no re-measurements of non-financial assets to fair value in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 or the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0"

We have (a) an Employee Stock Incentive Plan for officers, other employees, consultants and independent contractors under which we have granted options and restricted stock units to officers and other employees, (b) an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which shares of our common stock may be acquired by employees at discounted prices, and (c) a Non-Employee Director Stock Plan that provides for automatic grants of restricted shares of our common stock to non-employee directors. New shares of our common stock are issued upon stock option exercises, vesting of restricted stock units, issuances of shares to board members and issuances of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\u00a0\nEmployee Stock Incentive Plan\n\u00a0\nAs of\u00a0September 30, 2021, there were\u00a0\u2014\u00a0shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to future awards under our Employee Stock Incentive Plan and \u2014 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to outstanding awards under such plan. Although our Compensation Committee has authority to issue options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, share grants and other share-based benefits under our Employee Stock Incentive Plan, to date only restricted stock units and stock options have been granted under the plan. Options have been granted at an option price per share equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a four year period\u00a0and expire seven years\u00a0after the date of grant. Restricted stock units vest over a four year\u00a0period and entitle the holders to one share of our common stock for each restricted stock unit. Reserved shares underlying outstanding awards, including options and restricted stock units, that are forfeited are available under the Employee Stock Incentive Plan for future grant.\n\n\nNon-Employee Director Stock Plan\n\n\u00a0\nAs of September 30, 2021, there were\u00a0\u2014 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to future restricted share grants under our Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and \u2014 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to outstanding stock option awards under our Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (which previously authorized the granting of stock options to non-employee directors).\u00a0Under the terms of the plan, each non-employee director receives annual restricted share grants of\u00a02,000 shares of our common stock on the date of each annual meeting at which such director is elected to serve on the board. The annual restricted share grants of common stock vest in four equal quarterly installments during the year after the grant date, provided the non-employee director is still serving as a director on the applicable vesting date.\u00a0\n\nOn the date of our 2021\u00a0annual meeting, we issued\u00a08,000 shares of our common stock to our non-employee directors, which were restricted as specified in the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. The shares granted at the 2021 annual meeting had an aggregate fair market value on the date of grant equal to $224,000 (grant date fair value of $27.96 per share). As of September 30, 2021, none of these shares were vested.

The fair value of stock options has been determined using the Black-Scholes model.

We have (a) an Employee Stock Incentive Plan for officers, other employees, consultants and independent contractors under which we have granted options and restricted stock units to officers and other employees, (b) an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which shares of our common stock may be acquired by employees at discounted prices, and (c) a Non-Employee Director Stock Plan that provides for automatic grants of restricted shares of our common stock to non-employee directors. New shares of our common stock are issued upon stock option exercises, vesting of restricted stock units, issuances of shares to board members and issuances of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\u00a0\nEmployee Stock Incentive Plan\n\u00a0\nAs of\u00a0September 30, 2021, there were\u00a0\u2014\u00a0shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to future awards under our Employee Stock Incentive Plan and \u2014 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to outstanding awards under such plan. Although our Compensation Committee has authority to issue options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, share grants and other share-based benefits under our Employee Stock Incentive Plan, to date only restricted stock units and stock options have been granted under the plan. Options have been granted at an option price per share equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a four year period\u00a0and expire seven years\u00a0after the date of grant. Restricted stock units vest over a four year\u00a0period and entitle the holders to one share of our common stock for each restricted stock unit. Reserved shares underlying outstanding awards, including options and restricted stock units, that are forfeited are available under the Employee Stock Incentive Plan for future grant.\n\n\nNon-Employee Director Stock Plan\n\n\u00a0\nAs of September 30, 2021, there were\u00a0\u2014 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to future restricted share grants under our Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and \u2014 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to outstanding stock option awards under our Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (which previously authorized the granting of stock options to non-employee directors).\u00a0Under the terms of the plan, each non-employee director receives annual restricted share grants of\u00a02,000 shares of our common stock on the date of each annual meeting at which such director is elected to serve on the board. The annual restricted share grants of common stock vest in four equal quarterly installments during the year after the grant date, provided the non-employee director is still serving as a director on the applicable vesting date.\u00a0\n\nOn the date of our 2021\u00a0annual meeting, we issued\u00a08,000 shares of our common stock to our non-employee directors, which were restricted as specified in the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. The shares granted at the 2021 annual meeting had an aggregate fair market value on the date of grant equal to $224,000 (grant date fair value of $27.96 per share). As of September 30, 2021, none of these shares were vested. The aggregate fair value of the \u2014 unvested shares based on the closing price of our common stock on September 30, 2021 was $\u2014.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Option Activity\n\n\nThe following is a summary of stock option activity in the six months ended\u00a0September 30, 2021:\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Options Outstanding \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Weighted\u00a0Average\u00a0ExercisePrice\u00a0Per\u00a0Share \n\n\n\n\n Outstanding, December 31, 2020 \n\n\n 419,100 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 15.22 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Exercised \n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Outstanding, September 30, 2021 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Exercisable, September 30, 2021 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intrinsic value of an option is the amount by which the market price of the underlying common stock exceeds the option's exercise price.

While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of components provided by suppliers, warranty obligations do arise. These obligations are affected by product failure rates, the costs of materials used in correcting product failures and service delivery expenses incurred to make these corrections.

While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of components provided by suppliers, warranty obligations do arise. These obligations are affected by product failure rates, the costs of materials used in correcting product failures and service delivery expenses incurred to make these corrections. If actual product failure rates and material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are required and could be material. At the end of each reporting period, we revise our estimated warranty liability based on these factors. The current portion of our warranty liability is included as a component of accrued expenses.

INCOME TAXES:\n\nWe recorded income tax expense of $\u2014 in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to an income tax expense of $409,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2020. We recorded income tax expense of $\u2014 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to income tax expense of $462,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Our income tax expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflected an effective tax rate of approximately \u2014%, compared to an effective tax rate of approximately 10% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in effective income tax rate in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, was mainly due to a significant reduction in excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. Excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were negligible, compared to excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 of $0 and $0, respectively. On a recurring basis, our effective income tax rate is favorably impacted by the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, foreign tax credit and the impact from Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).\n\nWe have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and U.S.\u00a0GAAP income, R&D tax credit carry forwards and state net operating loss carry forwards. A deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes, when net operating loss carry forwards could be applied against future taxable income, or when tax credit carry forwards are utilized on our tax returns. We assess the\u00a0realizability\u00a0of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of any current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry forward periods, our experience with loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.

INCOME TAXES:\n\nWe recorded income tax expense of $\u2014 in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to an income tax expense of $409,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2020. We recorded income tax expense of $\u2014 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to income tax expense of $462,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Our income tax expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflected an effective tax rate of approximately \u2014%, compared to an effective tax rate of approximately 10% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in effective income tax rate in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, was mainly due to a significant reduction in excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. Excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were negligible, compared to excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 of $0 and $0, respectively. On a recurring basis, our effective income tax rate is favorably impacted by the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, foreign tax credit and the impact from Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).\n\nWe have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and U.S.\u00a0GAAP income, R&D tax credit carry forwards and state net operating loss carry forwards. A deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes, when net operating loss carry forwards could be applied against future taxable income, or when tax credit carry forwards are utilized on our tax returns. We assess the\u00a0realizability\u00a0of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of any current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry forward periods, our experience with loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. In analyzing the need for valuation allowances, we first considered our history of cumulative operating results for income tax purposes over the past three years in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, our financial performance in recent quarters, statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives. In addition, we considered both our near-term and long-term financial outlook.

Among other matters, we discuss (i) a possible world-wide recession or depression resulting from the economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic; (ii) the potential effect on our revenue and operating results of the Covid-19 crisis on our customers and suppliers, the markets for our products and the global supply chain; (iii) the availability of parts to meet customer orders; (iv) the level of anticipated revenues, gross margins, and expenses; (v) the timing of orders and shipments of our existing products, particularly our SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems for automated optical inspection (\"AOI\") and MX systems for memory module inspection; (vi) the level of orders from our original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") customers; (vii) the timing of initial revenue and projected improvements in gross margins from sales of new products that have been recently introduced, that we have under development or that we anticipate introducing in the future; (viii) the timing of and improvement in gross margins resulting from future cost reduction programs; (ix) market acceptance of our SQ3000 Multi-Function systems and products for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology; (x) our assessment of trends in the surface mount technology (\"SMT\") and semiconductor capital equipment markets; (xi) the impact of lower margin MX3000\u2122 memory module inspection systems on our consolidated gross margin in any future period; (xii) risks related to cancellation or renegotiation of orders we have received; and (xiii) changes in the level of tariffs and other trade policies of the United States, and trade relations with other countries. Although we have made these statements based on our experience and expectations regarding future events, there may be events or factors that we have not anticipated. Therefore, the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and estimates are subject to a number of risks, including those risks identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGeneral\n\nWe are a leading global developer and manufacturer of high precision 3D sensors and system products for inspection and metrology. We also develop and manufacture our WaferSense\u00ae products, which is a family of wireless, wafer-shaped sensors that provide measurements of critical factors in the semiconductor fabrication process. We intend to leverage our sensor technologies in the SMT and semiconductor industries to deliver profitable growth. A key element of our strategy is the continued development and sale of high precision 3D sensors and system products based on our proprietary Multi-Reflection Suppression\u2122 (MRS\u2122) technology. We believe that our MRS technology is a breakthrough 3D optical technology for high-end inspection and metrology with the potential to significantly expand our markets. Another key element in our strategy is the continued development and introduction of new sensor applications for our WaferSense\u00ae family of products.\n\u00a0\nWe believe that conditions in the SMT and semiconductor capital equipment markets are currently robust, and we believe this market strength will continue into the foreseeable future. Over the longer-term (i.e. the next several years), we expect a growing number of opportunities in the markets for SMT and semiconductor inspection and metrology. We believe that our 3D MRS sensor and system products and our WaferSense family of products have the potential to expand our presence in the markets for SMT and semiconductor capital equipment.\n\nManufacturing yield challenges as electronics and semiconductors become more complex are driving the need for more precise inspection and metrology. We believe\u00a03D inspection and metrology represent\u00a0high-growth segments in both the SMT and semiconductor capital equipment markets.\u00a0We believe\u00a0our 3D MRS technology platform is well suited for many applications in these markets, particularly with respect to complex circuit boards and semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology applications.\u00a0We are taking advantage of current market trends by deploying our 3D MRS sensor technology in the following products:\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n Our SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems for Automated Optical Inspection (AOI), Solder Paste Inspection (SPI) and coordinate measurement (CMM) applications, which are designed to expand our presence in markets requiring high precision inspection and metrology. In these markets, identifying defects has become highly challenging and critical due to smaller semiconductor and electronics packaging and increasing component density on circuit boards. We believe the 3D MRS sensor technology used in our products is uniquely suited for many of these applications because of its ability to offer microscopic image quality and superior measurement performance at production line speeds. We are developing an enhanced version of the SQ3000 Multi-Function system that will allow for inspection and metrology of features sizes down to 50-microns at in-line production speeds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n Our next generation MX3000\u2122 AOI system for 3D inspection of memory modules following the\u00a0singulation\u00a0step of the manufacturing process.\u00a0We recognized our first revenue from the sale of the MX3000\u00a0in the first quarter of 2020. Since late 2020, we have received new purchase orders for the MX3000 valued at $8.1 million. We recognized $0.0 million of the MX3000 orders as revenue in the third quarter of 2021, and expect to recognize a further $0.0 million of the MX3000 orders as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nOur next generation ultra-high resolution three micron pixel 3D NanoResolution\u00a0MRS\u2122 sensor, which is capable of measuring feature sizes down to 25 microns accurately and at high speeds, and is suitable for many semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology applications. We have adapted the software used in our SQ3000 Multi-Function systems to work with wafer handling equipment to facilitate sales of our 3D NanoResolution\u00a0MRS sensor to OEM's\u00a0and system integrators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n Our new WX3000\u2122 metrology and inspection system for wafer and advanced packing applications, which incorporates our next generation ultra-high resolution 3D NanoResolution MRS sensor. The WX3000 performs 100% 3D and 2D inspection and metrology simultaneously at high speeds and delivers through-put of more than 25 wafers per hour. We believe the WX3000 performs two to three times faster than alternate technologies at data processing speeds in excess of 75 million 3D data points per second. The WX3000 is suitable for many semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology applications for feature sizes down to 25-microns. We anticipate that sales of sensors and systems based on our\u00a03D MRS technology for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology applications will provide us with long-term growth opportunities.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRevenue from our MRS-based products, including 3D AOI systems and high precision 3D MRS sensors, increased by $0.0 million or 0% to $0.0 million in the nine months ended September 30,\u00a02021, from $23.8 million in the nine months ended september 30,\u00a02020. Over the long term, we anticipate continued increases in sales of products based on our MRS technology in the SMT and semiconductor capital equipment markets. In particular, we believe inspection and metrology for mini LED, memory modules and semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging applications represent significant long-term growth opportunities. We anticipate increasing sales of MRS-based products by selling them to new OEM customers and system integrators, and by expanding direct sales of inspection and metrology system products to end-user customers.\u00a0\n\nWe have continued to invest in our\u00a0WaferSense\u00a0family of products, because fabricators of semiconductors and other customers view these products as valuable tools for improving yields and productivity. We have recently introduced several new WaferSense\u00a0products to further increase our revenue growth, including the\u00a0In-Line Particle Sensor\u2122\u00a0(IPS\u2122). This sensor detects particles in gas and vacuum lines in semiconductor process equipment, and is particularly relevant for EUV lithography tools. Additional WaferSense\u00a0applications are currently under development. Over the long-term, strong future sales growth is anticipated for our WaferSense\u00a0family of products.\u00a0\n\nOur order backlog was a record $0.0 million at September 30, 2021, up from $45.3 million at June 30, 2021, and up from $17.7 million at September 30, 2020. Our backlog at September 30, 2021 includes approximately $0.0 million of longer-term orders from OEM customers that are scheduled for shipment in periods after 2021.\u00a0We\u00a0are forecasting sales of $0.0 million to $0.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2021\u00a0ending December 31, compared to $0.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.\u00a0Our forecast for the fourth quarter of 2021 includes $0.0 million of sales from our order backlog of MX memory module inspection systems. It is anticipated that there will be no revenue from MX memory module systems in the fourth quarter of 2021 due to normal quarterly variability\u00a0in the sales of these products. For this reason, aggregate sales in the fourth quarter of 2021 are expected to be lower than the third quarter of 2021 on a sequential quarterly basis. However, strong year-over-year sales growth is anticipated for the fourth quarter of 2021 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, which we believe will be driven by the Company's record backlog and the robust capital spending environment. We believe that demand in the SMT and semiconductor capital equipment markets will remain strong into the foreseeable future. However, an increase in the severity of the current Covid-19 outbreak, or a resulting prolonged economic recession or depression, could cause a slow-down in demand for SMT and semiconductor capital equipment. Over the long term, we believe\u00a0anticipated sales growth of our products based on\u00a03D MRS technology and WaferSense\u00a0sensors should increase revenues and net income. We believe that we have the resources required to attain our growth objectives, given our available cash and marketable securities balances totaling $0.0 million at September 30, 2021.\n\nImpact from\u00a0Covid-19\n\nEffect of Covid-19 Outbreak on Business Operations\n\nCovid-19 was first identified in December 2019, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized Covid-19 as a pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting our customers, suppliers, service providers and employees to varying degrees, and the ultimate impacts of Covid-19, including the potential impact of known and future variants, on our business, results of operations, liquidity and prospects are not fully known at this time. However, the Covid-19 outbreak has had a relatively minimal impact on our business to date. Our revenues increased by 0% to $0.0 million in the first nine months of 2021, from $53.2 million in the first nine months of 2020. We are forecasting sales of $0.0 million to $0.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2021\u00a0ending September 30, compared to $0.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our forecast for the fourth quarter of 2021 could change if the Covid-19 pandemic worsens, or if unforeseen events related to the pandemic occur. The most significant impacts on our business from the Covid-19 pandemic include the following:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nOur key factories are located in Minnesota and Singapore. Both of these locations have been subject to government mandated shelter-in-place orders. Because our operations have been deemed essential, we were able to keep our factories up and running while the shelter-in-place mandates were in effect. If the pandemic worsens, it is possible that our operations may not be deemed essential under future government mandated shelter-in-place orders, and we may be required to shut-down factory operations. We have periodically implemented split-shifts for our factory operations to minimize the number of employees in our facilities at any given time, but these measures have not affected our production capacity. Since the start of the pandemic, many of our non-factory employees have spent the majority of their time working remotely. To date, the shelter-in-place mandates and remote work arrangements have had a minimal impact on operations, but that could change if the pandemic worsens and is more than temporary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\nSales of some products, mainly our SQ3000 Multi-Function systems and MX memory module inspection products, require customer acceptance due to performance or other criteria that is considered more than a formality. Most of our customer\u2019s factories have remained open during the Covid-19 pandemic because they are deemed to be essential under government shelter-in-place mandates. However, global travel restrictions and quarantine measures have hindered our ability to obtain customer acceptances of certain of our products at various times in 2020. Continuing or new global travel restrictions and quarantine measures could hinder our ability to obtain customer acceptances in a timely manner in the future, and therefore impact the timing of revenue recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\nTotal operating expenses were reduced in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0Travel, trade show expenses and other costs were reduced due to changes in employee travel patterns and trade show cancellations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\nWe have experienced some supply disruptions due to the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic, mainly from suppliers not deemed essential by shelter-in-place mandates in certain countries. Key supply chain disruptions have been resolved to date. However, supply chain disruptions could increase significantly if the pandemic worsens and continues for an extended period of time. To date, our on-hand inventories have been sufficient to enable us to mitigate any supply disruptions with minimal impact on our sales or ability to service customers. We\u00a0presently do not expect that Covid-19 related supply chain disruptions will have a significant impact on our revenue in the third quarter of\u00a02021.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nWe currently do not anticipate any significant credit losses or asset impairments resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. As of September 30, 2021, our available balances of cash and marketable securities totaled $0.0 million. We believe that we have the resources required to attain our growth objectives and to meet any unforeseen difficulties resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. However, we will continue to closely monitor the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on our business in the coming months.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUnited States Covid-19 Relief Legislation\u00a0\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") was signed into law in the United States. The CARES Act, among\u00a0other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of\u00a0employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback\u00a0periods and alternative tax credit refunds. The CARES Act also appropriated funds for the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loans that are forgivable in certain circumstances to promote continued employment. Additional relief packages were passed in December 2020 and March 2021. We have analyzed these pieces of legislation and presently do not believe they will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we will continue to monitor the impact that these pieces of legislation could have on our business in the future.\u00a0\n\nSingapore Jobs Support Program\n\nThe Singapore Government implemented a jobs support program in 2020 that was intended to support businesses and encourage retention of employees during the period of economic uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the jobs support program, the Singapore Government co-funded a portion of the gross monthly wages paid to local employees, which reduced our operating expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 by $276,000 and $295,000, respectively. We did not receive any material benefit from the Singapore jobs support program in the three or nine months ended September 30, 2021, nor do we expect to receive any material benefits in future periods.\n\nRevenues\nOur revenues\u00a0decreased\u00a0by 100% to $\u2014\u00a0million in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2021, from $20.8\u00a0million in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2020. Our revenues decreased by 100% to $\u2014 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $53.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0The following table sets forth revenues by product line for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n\n\n\n(In thousands)\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\n% Change\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n% Change\n\n\n\nHigh Precision 3D\u00a0and 2D Sensors\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n3,645\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n%\n\n$\n\u2014\n\n\n$\n12,512\n\n\n\n(100)\n%\n\n\n\nInspection and Metrology Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13,339\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29,361\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nSemiconductor Sensors\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3,836\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11,372\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n20,820\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n53,245\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(100)\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevenues from sales of high precision 3D and 2D sensors decreased by $3.6 million or 100% to $\u2014 million in the three months ended September 30, 2021, from $3.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Revenues from sales of high precision 3D and 2D sensors decreased by $12.5 million or 100% to $\u2014\u00a0million\u00a0in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $12.5\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increases were due to higher sales of both\u00a03D MRS sensors and legacy 2D sensors resulting from improving conditions in the global semiconductor and SMT capital equipment markets.\u00a0Sales of high precision 3D MRS sensors increased by $0.0 million or 0% to $0.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2021, from $2.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0Sales of high precision 3D MRS sensors increased by $0.0 million or 0% to $0.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $8.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\nSales of high precision 3D and 2D sensors are dependent on the success of our OEM customers and system integrators selling products that incorporate our sensors. We believe sales of our\u00a03D MRS sensors, including our next generation ultra-high resolution three micron pixel 3D NanoResolution MRS sensor, will represent an increasing percentage of our total high precision 3D and 2D sensor sales in the future. Sales of high precision 3D and 2D sensors, including 3D MRS sensors, are prone to significant quarterly fluctuations due to variations in market demand and customer inventory levels. Revenues from sales of high precision 3D and 2D sensors are forecasted to post strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2021.\u00a0\nRevenues from sales of inspection and metrology systems decreased by $13.3 million or 100% to $\u2014 million in the three months ended September 30, 2021, from $13.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Revenues from sales of inspection and metrology systems\u00a0decreased\u00a0by $29.4 million or 100%\u00a0to $\u2014\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $29.4\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0The increases were due to higher sales of SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems and MX3000\u2122 memory module inspection systems resulting from improving market conditions, and increasing sales from more complex applications such as inspection and metrology for mini-LED and memory modules. Sales of\u00a0SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems increased by $0.0 million or 0% to $0.0 million in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2021, from $6.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0Sales of\u00a0SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems\u00a0increased\u00a0by $0.0 million\u00a0or 0% to $0.0\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $14.8\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0Sales of\u00a02D and\u00a03D MX memory module inspection systems totaled $0.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021. There were no sales of MX systems in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Sales of 2D and 3D MX systems totaled $4.7 million in the nine months ended september 30, 2020.\u00a0Revenues from sales of inspection and metrology systems are forecasted to grow solidly in the fourth quarter of 2021 on a year-over-year basis.\u00a0\nWe believe the increase in sales of SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was due to the competitive advantages offered by our SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function system products, particularly for more complex applications,\u00a0and resulted from many companies transitioning from 2D AOI to 3D AOI systems to meet the increasingly demanding product inspection and metrology requirements in the SMT and semiconductor markets. The market transition away from 2D AOI systems is expected to result in an industry-wide 20% compound annual rate of growth in global sales of 3D AOI systems through 2025.\u00a0Given these market dynamics and because of the competitive advantages of our 3D MRS sensor technology, we anticipate sales of SQ3000\u2122 Multi-Function systems will represent an increasing percentage of our total inspection and metrology system sales in the future.\nSince late\u00a02020, we have received new purchase orders for the MX3000\u00a0valued at $8.1 million. We recognized $0.0\u00a0million of the MX3000 orders as revenue in the third quarter of\u00a02021, and expect to recognize a further $0.0 million of the MX3000 orders as revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021.\u00a0We believe memory manufacturers have determined that post singulation automated optical inspection of memory modules is an important step in their manufacturing process to improve yields and product quality. Two of the world's three largest memory manufacturers now use either our 2D MX600\u2122 or 3D MX3000 memory module inspection systems. As a result, we believe the potential market opportunity for our 2D and 3D memory module inspection systems is significant and anticipate that sales of these systems will continue in the future.\nRevenues from sales of semiconductor sensors, principally our WaferSense\u00a0line of products, decreased by $0.0 million or 100% to $\u2014 million in the three months ended September 30, 2021, from $3.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Revenues from sales of semiconductor sensors increased by $0.0 million or 100% to $\u2014 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $11.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The revenue increases were due to construction of new semiconductor\u00a0fabs, favorable market conditions for semiconductor capital equipment spending, and the growing acceptance of our WaferSense products as important productivity enhancement tools by semiconductor manufacturers and capital equipment suppliers. Over the long term, we anticipate that the benefits from growing market awareness of our WaferSense products, improved account penetration at major semiconductor manufacturers and capital equipment suppliers and new product introductions will lead to additional WaferSense product sales. Revenues from sales of semiconductor sensors are forecasted to post strong year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nExport revenues totaled $\u2014 million or #DIV/0!% of our revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $17.5 million or 84% of our revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Export\u00a0revenues\u00a0totaled $\u2014\u00a0million or\u00a0#DIV/0!% of our revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $42.7\u00a0million or\u00a080% of our revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Export revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 due to higher sales of 3D and 2D high precision sensors, semiconductor sensors and\u00a0MX3000\u2122 memory module inspection systems. A higher proportion of these products are generally sold outside the United States as compared to our other products.\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of Revenues and Gross Margin\u00a0\n\nCost of revenues\u00a0decreased\u00a0by $0.0 million or 100% to $\u2014 million in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2021, from $12.1\u00a0million in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2020. Cost of revenues\u00a0decreased\u00a0by $0.0 million\u00a0or\u00a0100% to $\u2014\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, from $30.0\u00a0million in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020. Total gross margin as a percentage of revenues was\u00a0#DIV/0!%\u00a0in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to\u00a042% in the\u00a0three months ended September 30, 2020. Total gross margin as a percentage of revenues was\u00a0#DIV/0!% in both the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0The increase in cost of revenues in both periods was mainly due to higher revenues. Revenues increased on a year-over-year basis in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 by 0% and 0%, respectively. Cost of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2021 were negatively impacted by a less favorable sales mix of lower gross margin products. Sales of lower gross margin inspection and metrology system products, including $0.0 million of MX3000\u2122 memory module inspection systems, represented a larger percentage of our total revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2021, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0\n\nOur total gross margin as a percentage of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2021\u00a0is expected to decline by roughly 1-2 percentage points from the level in the third quarter of 2021, reflecting an increased proportion of lower gross margin inspection and metrology systems in our revenue mix, including $4.9 million of MX3000\u00a0memory module inspection systems.\u00a0We anticipate sequential quarterly improvement in our total gross margin percentage for the fourth quarter of 2021, given that we are not expecting any sales of lower gross margin\u00a0MX3000\u2122 systems in the quarter.\u00a0\n\nOur markets are highly price competitive, particularly in the electronics assembly and SMT markets. As a result, we have experienced continual pressure on our gross margins. We compensate for the pressure to reduce the price of our products by introducing new products with more features and improved performance and through manufacturing cost reduction programs. Sales of many products that we have recently introduced or are about to introduce, including our current and future SQ3000\u00a0Multi-Function systems, WX3000 system for semiconductor wafer and advanced packaging inspection and metrology, next generation 3D MRS sensors and semiconductor sensors (consisting primarily of our WaferSense\u00a0line of products) have, or are expected to have, more favorable gross margins than many of our existing products. Our next generation 3D MRS sensor and system products are being designed for more complex and demanding inspection and metrology applications in the SMT and semiconductor markets. Sales prices and gross profit margins for these applications tend to be higher than margins for products sold in the general purpose SMT market. However, the gross margin percentage for our\u00a03D MX3000\u00a0system for inspection of memory modules will be lower than our current total gross margin percentage due to the significant costs for material handling and automation required for this product.\u00a0\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nR&D expenses were $\u2014 million or #DIV/0!% of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $2.4 million or 12% of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2020. R&D expenses were $\u2014\u00a0million or\u00a0#DIV/0!% of revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $7.0 million or 13% of revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0The increase in R&D expenses in the three and\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021 was mainly due to higher compensation costs for new and existing R&D employees, including incentive compensation accruals, and higher costs for engineering prototypes. R&D expenses in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 were reduced by $61,000 and $307,000, respectively, due to the favorable impact of the Singapore Government's jobs support program on wage costs discussed above. Current R&D expenditures are primarily focused on the continued development of our portfolio of next generation 3D\u00a0MRS\u00a0sensor and system products and continued R&D work on WaferSense\u00a0products. We also continue to enhance and develop new generations of our SQ3000\u00a0Multi-Function systems and 3D MX3000 memory module inspection systems.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"S,G&A\") expenses were $\u2014 million or #DIV/0!% of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $4.1 million or 20% of revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $\u2014\u00a0million or\u00a0#DIV/0!% of revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to $11.9\u00a0million or\u00a022% of revenues in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\u00a0The increase in S,G&A expenses in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was due to higher third party channel commissions resulting from the significant revenue increases in both periods, higher accruals for incentive compensation given our improved financial performance, and an increase in our accounts receivable allowance and related expense.\nTotal operating expenses in the third quarter of 2021 are forecasted to be at or near the level in this year's second quarter.\u00a0\n\nInterest Income and Other\n\u00a0\nInterest income and other includes interest earned on investments and gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions, primarily intercompany financing transactions associated with our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Singapore, China and Taiwan. We recognized losses from foreign currency transactions of $\u2014 in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to losses from foreign currency transactions of $77,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2020. We recognized losses from foreign currency transactions of $\u2014\u00a0in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to gains from foreign currency transactions of $65,000\u00a0in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2020.\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\u00a0\n\n\nWe recorded income tax expense of $0 in the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared to an income tax expense of $409,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2020. We recorded income tax expense of $0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to income tax expense of $462,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Our income tax expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflected an effective tax rate of approximately 0%, compared to an effective tax rate of approximately 10% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in effective income tax rate in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, was mainly due to a significant reduction in excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. Excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were negligible, compared to excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 of $0 and $0, respectively. On a recurring basis, our effective income tax rate is favorably impacted by the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, foreign tax credit and the impact from Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).\n\nWe have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between the taxable income on our tax returns and U.S.\u00a0GAAP income, R&D tax credit carry forwards and state net operating loss carry forwards. A deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes, when net operating loss carry forwards could be applied against future taxable income, or when tax credit carry forwards are utilized on our tax returns. We assess the\u00a0realizability\u00a0of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of any current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry forward periods, our experience with credit and loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. In analyzing the need for valuation allowances, we first considered our history of cumulative operating results for income tax purposes over the past three years in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, our financial performance in recent quarters, statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives. In addition, we considered both our near-term and long-term financial outlook. After considering all available evidence (both positive and negative), we concluded that recognition of valuation allowances for substantially all of our U.S. and Singapore based deferred tax assets was not required at September 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has initiated a routine compliance review of our\u00a02018\u00a0income tax return.\u00a0We presently anticipate that the outcome of this audit will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents increased by $0.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Cash provided by operating activities of $0.0 million and proceeds of $0.0 million from maturities and sales of marketable securities were partially offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling $\u2014 million and purchases of fixed assets\u00a0and capitalized patent costs totaling $0.0 million. Proceeds from stock option exercises totaled\u00a0$\u2014. Our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of sales and maturities of marketable securities and investment of cash balances in marketable securities, and from other sources of cash. Accordingly, we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity than cash balances alone. Combined balances of cash and marketable securities decreased by $30.6 million to $\u2014\u00a0million as of September 30, 2021, from $30.6 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\nOperating activities provided $\u2014 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The amount of cash provided by operations was favorably impacted by net income of $\u2014 million. Net income was affected by non-cash expenses totaling $\u2014 million for depreciation and amortization, non-cash operating lease expense, provision for doubtful accounts, deferred taxes, non-cash losses from foreign currency transactions, share-based compensation costs and an unrealized gain on our available-for-sale equity security. Changes in operating assets and liabilities providing cash included an increase in accounts payable of $0.0 million and an increase in accrued expenses of $0. Changes in operating assets and liabilities using cash included an increase in accounts and trade notes receivable of $0.0 million, an increase in inventories of $0.0 million and a decrease in operating lease liabilities of $0.\u00a0Increases in accounts payable and inventories at September 30, 2021 were due to planned purchases of raw materials to meet anticipated customer demand. The increase in accrued expenses was mainly due to higher accruals for income taxes payable and wages, including incentive compensation, offset in part by payment of 2020 bonus accruals in the first quarter of 2021. Accounts and trade notes receivable increased due to higher sales in the third quarter of 2021 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in operating lease liabilities was due to monthly rental payments for facility leases.\u00a0\n\nInvesting activities used $0.0 million of cash in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021. Changes in the level of investment in marketable securities, resulting from purchases and maturities of those securities, used $0 of cash in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021. We used $0.0 million of cash in the\u00a0nine months ended September 30, 2021\u00a0for the purchase of fixed assets and capitalized patent costs.\u00a0\u00a0\nFinancing activities provided $\u2014 of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2021\u00a0from the exercise of employee stock options.\u00a0\nAt\u00a0September 30, 2021, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. These entities are established by some companies for the purpose of establishing off-balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nWe believe that on-hand cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, coupled with anticipated future cash flow from operations, will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nITEM 3 \u2013 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nNot applicable.\n\nITEM 4 \u2013 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\na.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)).

Most of our customer\u2019s factories have remained open during the Covid-19 pandemic because they are deemed to be essential under government shelter-in-place mandates. However, global travel restrictions and quarantine measures have hindered our ability to obtain customer acceptances of certain of our products at various times in 2020. Continuing or new global travel restrictions and quarantine measures could hinder our ability to obtain customer acceptances in a timely manner in the future, and therefore impact the timing of revenue recognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\nTotal operating expenses were reduced in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0Travel, trade show expenses and other costs were reduced due to changes in employee travel patterns and trade show cancellations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\nWe have experienced some supply disruptions due to the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic, mainly from suppliers not deemed essential by shelter-in-place mandates in certain countries. Key supply chain disruptions have been resolved to date. However, supply chain disruptions could increase significantly if the pandemic worsens and continues for an extended period of time. To date, our on-hand inventories have been sufficient to enable us to mitigate any supply disruptions with minimal impact on our sales or ability to service customers. We\u00a0presently do not expect that Covid-19 related supply chain disruptions will have a significant impact on our revenue in the third quarter of\u00a02021.\u00a0\n\n\n\n"

We recorded income tax expense of $0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021, compared to income tax expense of $462,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Our income tax expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflected an effective tax rate of approximately 0%, compared to an effective tax rate of approximately 10% in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The increase in effective income tax rate in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, was mainly due to a significant reduction in excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. Excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 were negligible, compared to excess tax benefits in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 of $0 and $0, respectively. On a recurring basis, our effective income tax rate is favorably impacted by the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, foreign tax credit and the impact from Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).\n\nWe have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between the taxable income on our tax returns and U.S.\u00a0GAAP income, R&D tax credit carry forwards and state net operating loss carry forwards. A deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes, when net operating loss carry forwards could be applied against future taxable income, or when tax credit carry forwards are utilized on our tax returns. We assess the\u00a0realizability\u00a0of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of any current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry forward periods, our experience with credit and loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. In analyzing the need for valuation allowances, we first considered our history of cumulative operating results for income tax purposes over the past three years in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, our financial performance in recent quarters, statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives. In addition, we considered both our near-term and long-term financial outlook. After considering all available evidence (both positive and negative), we concluded that recognition of valuation allowances for substantially all of our U.S. and Singapore based deferred tax assets was not required at September 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has initiated a routine compliance review of our\u00a02018\u00a0income tax return.\u00a0We presently anticipate that the outcome of this audit will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.\u00a0\n\n\n"
