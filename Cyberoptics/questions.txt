this information in excel and we have to extract all the information similar to that and embed the same in the HTML
document.


Do we have to extract tables? If yes what is the significance?



Do we have similar layout structure for these documnets? how much vary

Do we have PDFs instead of HTML? If yes how many? We prefer HTML. Should we expect other types of doc like .dox, .txt, Scanned ?




Are you expecting the revelancy of element names with different section of the text.

Are you expecting an API endpoint for this feature extraction where if client provide HTML doc, 
api will detect iXBRL information for the given HTML dcoument and the excel and add the capabilities in api
