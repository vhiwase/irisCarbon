COVID-19 PANDEMIC:\n\nEffect of Covid-19 Outbreak on Business Operations\n\nA novel strain of coronavirus (\"Covid-19\") was first identified in December 2019, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization categorized Covid-19\u00a0as a pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting our customers, suppliers, service providers and employees to varying degrees, and the ultimate impacts of Covid-19, including the potential impact of known and future variants, on our business, results of operations, liquidity and prospects are not fully known at this time.\u00a0The\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0outbreak has not had a significant impact on our business to date. However, the following factors have affected and may continue to affect our business:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\nOur key factories are located in Minnesota and Singapore. Both of these locations have been subject to government mandated shelter-in-place orders. Because our operations have been deemed essential, we were able to keep our factories up and running while the shelter-in-place mandates were in effect. If the pandemic worsens, it is possible that our operations may not be deemed essential under future government mandated shelter-in-place orders, and we may be required to shut-down factory operations. We have periodically implemented split-shifts for our factory operations to minimize the number of employees in our facilities at any given time, but these measures have not affected our production capacity. Since the start of the pandemic, many of our non-factory employees have spent the majority of their time working remotely.\u00a0To date, the shelter-in-place mandates and remote work arrangements have had a minimal impact on operations, but material negative effects on our business could result if the pandemic worsens and continues for an extended period of time.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\nSales of some products, mainly our SQ3000\u00a0Multi-Function systems and MX memory module inspection products, require customer acceptance due to performance or other criteria that is considered more than a formality. Most of our customer\u2019s factories have remained open during the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic because they are deemed to be essential under government shelter-in-place mandates. However, global travel restrictions and quarantine measures have hindered our ability to obtain customer acceptances of certain products at various times in 2020. Continuing or new global travel restrictions and quarantine measures could hinder our ability to obtain customer acceptances in a timely manner in the future, and therefore impact the timing of revenue recognition.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00b7\nWe have experienced some supply disruptions due to the\u00a0Covid-19\u00a0pandemic, mainly from suppliers not deemed essential by shelter-in-place mandates in certain countries. Key supply chain disruptions have been resolved to date. However, supply chain disruptions could increase significantly if the pandemic worsens and continues for an extended period of time. To date, our on-hand inventories have been sufficient to enable us to mitigate supply disruptions.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough we cannot estimate the continuing impact of the Covid-19 outbreak at this time, it may have an adverse effect on our results of future operations, financial position and liquidity for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Covid-19 Relief Legislation\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") was signed into law in the United States. The CARES Act, among\u00a0other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, net operating loss carryback\u00a0periods and alternative tax credit refunds. The CARES Act also appropriated funds for the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program loans that are forgivable in certain circumstances to promote continued employment. Additional relief packages were passed in December 2020 and March 2021. We have analyzed these pieces of legislation and presently do not believe they will have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we will continue to monitor the impact these pieces of legislation could have on our business in the future.\n\nSingapore Jobs Support Program\n\nThe Singapore Government implemented a jobs support program in 2020 that was intended to support businesses and encourage retention of employees during the\u00a0period of economic uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Under the jobs support program, the Singapore Government co-funded a portion of the gross monthly wages paid to local employees, which reduced our operating expenses\u00a0in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 by $276,000 and $295,000, respectively.\u00a0We did not receive any material benefit from the Singapore jobs support program in the three or six months ended June 30, 2021, nor do we expect to receive any material benefits in future periods.\u00a0\n\n"

Accounts and trade notes receivable are recorded when the right to payment becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities consist of payments received in advance of performance under the contract.

securities all have maturities of less than five years. Net pre-tax unrealized gains for marketable debt securities of $105,000 at June 30, 2021 and $229,000 at December 31, 2020 have been recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders\u2019 equity. We have determined that the net pre-tax unrealized losses for marketable debt securities at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were caused by fluctuations in interest rates and are temporary in nature. We review our marketable debt securities to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, credit quality and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. We received proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $225,000 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021. The gain recognized on the sale was insignificant.\u00a0\u00a0No marketable securities were sold in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020. \u00a0See Note 6 for additional information regarding the fair value of our investments in marketable securities.\n\nInvestments\u00a0in marketable securities classified as cash equivalents of $6.0\u00a0million at\u00a0June 30, 2021 and $1.3 million at December 31, 2020, consist of commercial money market savings accounts, corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:\n\nWe determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. We use a fair value hierarchy with three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last\u00a0is considered unobservable, to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level\u00a01). The next highest priority is based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets or other observable inputs (Level 2). The lowest priority is given to unobservable inputs (Level 3).\u00a0The following provides information regarding fair value measurements for our marketable securities as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020\u00a0according to the three-level fair value hierarchy:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nFair Value Measurements atJune 30, 2021\u00a0Using\n\n\n\n\n (In thousands) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBalance\nJune 30,\u00a02021\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Quoted\u00a0Pricesin\u00a0ActiveMarkets\u00a0forIdenticalAssets(Level\u00a01) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level\u00a02) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level\u00a03) \n\n\n\n\n Marketable securities: \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n U.S. government and agency obligations \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 12,466 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 12,466 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit\u00a0\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 7,375 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 7,375 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Asset backed securities \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 2,596 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 2,596 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Equity security \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 42 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 42 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Total marketable securities\u00a0\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 22,479 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 42 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 22,437 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nFair Value Measurements atDecember 31, 2020\u00a0Using\n\n\n\n\n (In thousands) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\nBalance\nDecember 31,\n2020\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Quoted\u00a0Pricesin\u00a0ActiveMarkets\u00a0forIdenticalAssets(Level\u00a01) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantOtherObservableInputs(Level\u00a02) \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level\u00a03) \n\n\n\n\n Marketable securities: \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n U.S. government and agency obligations \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 12,448 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 12,448 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 7,169 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 7,169 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Asset backed securities \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 2,526 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 2,526 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Equity security \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 30 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 30 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Total marketable securities \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 22,173 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 30 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 22,143 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n \u2014 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, we owned no Level 3 securities and there were no transfers within the three level hierarchy.

The fair value for our equity security is based on a quoted market price obtained from an active market. The carrying amounts of financial instruments included in cash equivalents approximate their related fair values due to the short-term maturities of those instruments. See Note 5 for additional information regarding our investments in marketable securities.\n\n\nNon-financial assets such as equipment and leasehold improvements, goodwill and intangible assets and right-of-use assets for operating leases are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed impaired. We had no re-measurements of non-financial assets to fair value in the six months ended June 30, 2021 or the six months ended June 30, 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fair value for\u00a0trade notes receivable is based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates that would be offered for a similar\u00a0transaction to a similarly situated customer. The difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for trade notes receivable is immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in\u00a0the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2021, our trade notes receivable were deemed to be fully collectible, and no trade notes receivable were past due more than 90 days or in a non-accrual status with respect to interest income.\n\n"

        "text": "\n7. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION:\n\nWe have\u00a0three\u00a0share-based compensation plans that are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. We have (a) an Employee Stock Incentive Plan for officers, other employees, consultants and independent contractors under which we have granted options and restricted stock units to officers and other employees, (b) an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which shares of our common stock may be acquired by employees at discounted prices, and (c) a Non-Employee Director Stock Plan that provides for automatic grants of restricted shares of our common stock to non-employee directors. New shares of our common stock are issued upon stock option exercises, vesting of restricted stock units, issuances of shares to board members and issuances of shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\u00a0\nEmployee Stock Incentive Plan\n\u00a0\nAs of\u00a0June 30, 2021, there were\u00a0124,501\u00a0shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to future awards under our Employee Stock Incentive Plan and 467,679 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to outstanding awards under such plan. Although our Compensation Committee has authority to issue options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, share grants and other share-based benefits under our Employee Stock Incentive Plan, to date only restricted stock units and stock options have been granted under the plan. Options have been granted at an option price per share equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, vest over a four year period\u00a0and expire seven years\u00a0after the date of grant. Restricted stock units vest over a four year\u00a0period and entitle the holders to one share of our common stock for each restricted stock unit. Reserved shares underlying outstanding awards, including options and restricted stock units, that are forfeited are available under the Employee Stock Incentive Plan for future grant.\n\n\nNon-Employee Director Stock Plan\n\n\u00a0\nAs of June 30, 2021, there were\u00a036,000 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to future restricted share grants under our Non-Employee Director Stock Plan and 8,000 shares of common stock reserved in the aggregate for issuance pursuant to outstanding stock option awards under our Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (which previously authorized the granting of stock options to non-employee directors).\u00a0Under the terms of the plan, each non-employee director receives annual restricted share grants of\u00a02,000 shares of our common stock on the date of each annual meeting at which such director is elected to serve on the board. The annual restricted share grants of common stock vest in four equal quarterly installments during the year after the grant date, provided the non-employee director is still serving as a director on the applicable vesting date.\u00a0\n\nOn the date of our 2021\u00a0annual meeting, we issued\u00a08,000 shares of our common stock to our non-employee directors, which were restricted as specified in the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan. The shares granted at the 2021 annual meeting had an aggregate fair market value on the date of grant equal to $224,000 (grant date fair value of $27.96 per share). As of June 30, 2021, none of these shares were vested. The aggregate fair value of the 8,000 unvested shares based on the closing price of our common stock on June 30, 2021 was $328,000.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Option Activity\n\n\nThe following is a summary of stock option activity in the six months ended\u00a0June 30, 2021:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Options Outstanding \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n Weighted\u00a0Average\u00a0ExercisePrice\u00a0Per\u00a0Share \n\n\n\n\n Outstanding, December 31, 2020 \n\n\n 419,100 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 15.22 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Exercised \n\n\n(7,875\n\n)\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n 17.09 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Outstanding, June 30, 2021 \n\n\n 411,225 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 15.19 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n Exercisable, June 30, 2021 \n\n\n 286,151 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n $ \n\n\n 12.90 \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe intrinsic value of an option is the amount by which the market price of the underlying common stock exceeds the option's exercise price. For options outstanding at\u00a0June 30, 2021, the weighted average remaining contractual term of all outstanding options was\u00a03.12 years and their aggregate intrinsic value was $10.6 million.

No stock options vested in the six months ended June 30, 2021 or the six months ended June 30, 2020. No stock options were granted, forfeited or expired in the six months ended June 30, 2021.\u00a0\n\nRestricted Shares and Restricted Stock Units\nThere were 8,000 restricted shares granted under our Non-Employee Director Stock Plan in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Restricted stock units can be granted under our Employee Stock Incentive Plan. There were no restricted stock units granted in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The fair value of restricted shares and restricted stock units is equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.\u00a0The aggregate fair value of outstanding restricted shares and restricted\u00a0stock units based on the closing share price of our common stock as of June 30, 2021 was $3.0\u00a0million. The aggregate fair value of restricted shares and restricted stock units that vested, based on the closing price of our common stock on the vesting date, was $115,000\u00a0in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and $102,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2020.

Under the terms of the plan, eligible employees may designate from 1%\u00a0to 10%\u00a0of their compensation to be withheld through payroll deductions, up to a maximum of $6,500 in each plan year, for the purchase of common stock at 85% of the lower of the market price on the first or last day of the offering period (which begins on August 1st and ends on July 31st of each year). No\u00a0shares were purchased under this plan in the six months ended June 30, 2021\u00a0or the six months ended June 30, 2020.\u00a0 As of June 30, 2021, 136,971 shares remain available for future purchase under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nShare-Based Compensation Information\u00a0\nAll share-based payments to employees and non-employee directors, including grants of stock options, restricted stock units and restricted shares, are required to be recognized as an expense in our consolidated statements of income based on the grant date fair value of the award. We utilize the straight-line method of expense recognition over the award's\u00a0service period for our graded vesting options. The fair value of stock options has been determined using the Black-Scholes model. We account for the impact of forfeitures related to employee share-based payment arrangements when the forfeitures occur. We have classified employee share-based compensation within our consolidated statements of income in the same manner as our cash-based employee compensation costs.\u00a0\nPre-tax share-based compensation expense in the three months ended June 30, 2021 totaled $337,000, and included $125,000 for stock options, $31,000 for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, $124,000 for restricted stock units and $57,000 for restricted shares.\u00a0Pre-tax share-based compensation expense in the\u00a0six months ended June 30, 2021\u00a0totaled $671,000, and included $248,000\u00a0for stock options,\u00a0$63,000\u00a0for our Employee\u00a0Stock Purchase Plan, $247,000\u00a0for restricted stock units and $113,000\u00a0for restricted shares.\n\u00a0\nPre-tax share-based compensation expense in the\u00a0three months ended June 30, 2020\u00a0totaled $286,000, and included $114,000 for stock options, $25,000 for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, $101,000 for restricted stock units and $46,000 for restricted shares.\u00a0Pre-tax share-based compensation expense in the\u00a0six months ended June 30, 2020\u00a0totaled $558,000, and included $228,000\u00a0for stock options, $48,000\u00a0for our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, $202,000\u00a0for restricted stock units and $80,000\u00a0for restricted shares.\n\nAt June 30, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements was $2.3 million and the related weighted average period over which such cost is expected to be recognized was 2.51 years.\n"

While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of components provided by suppliers, warranty obligations do arise. These obligations are affected by product failure rates, the costs of materials used in correcting product failures and service delivery expenses incurred to make these corrections. If actual product failure rates and material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are required and could be material. At the end of each reporting period, we revise our estimated warranty liability based on these factors. The current portion of our warranty liability is included as a component of accrued expenses.

INCOME TAXES:\n\nWe recorded income tax expense of $590,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2021, compared to an income tax benefit of $96,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2020. We recorded income tax expense of $901,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2021, compared to income tax expense of $53,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2020. Our income tax expense in the six months ended June 30, 2021 reflected an effective tax rate of approximately 17%, compared to an effective tax rate of approximately 2% in the six months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in effective income tax rate in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, when compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, was mainly due to a significant reduction in excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises. Excess tax benefits in the three and six months ended June 30, 2021 were negligible, compared to excess tax benefits in the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 of $340,000 and $356,000, respectively. On a recurring basis, our effective income tax rate is favorably impacted by the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, foreign tax credit and the impact from Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI).\n\nWe have significant deferred tax assets as a result of temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and U.S.\u00a0GAAP income, R&D tax credit carry forwards and state net operating loss carry forwards. A deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when temporary differences previously reported in our consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes, when net operating loss carry forwards could be applied against future taxable income, or when tax credit carry forwards are utilized on our tax returns. We assess the\u00a0realizability\u00a0of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the guidance provided in current financial accounting standards.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The assessment of whether valuation allowances are required considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of any current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry forward periods, our experience with loss carry forwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives. In analyzing the need for valuation allowances, we first considered our history of cumulative operating results for income tax purposes over the past three years in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, our financial performance in recent quarters, statutory carry forward periods and tax planning alternatives. In addition, we considered both our near-term and long-term financial outlook. After considering all available evidence (both positive and negative), we concluded that recognition of valuation allowances for substantially all of our U.S. and Singapore based deferred tax assets was not required at June 30, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has initiated a routine compliance review of our\u00a02018\u00a0income tax return.\u00a0We presently anticipate that the outcome of this audit will not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations.\u00a0\u00a0\n"

While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management presently believes the disposition of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\u00a0\n\nIn the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products and services, we at times indemnify other parties, including customers, with respect to certain matters. In these instances, we have agreed to hold the other parties harmless against losses arising out of intellectual property infringement or other types of claims. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made, and almost always limits the amount of the claim. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of exposure under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made, if any, under these agreements have not had a material impact on our operating results, financial position or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that intellectual property infringement and other claims against us or parties we have indemnified will not have a greater impact in the future.\n"
